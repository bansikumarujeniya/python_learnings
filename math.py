#1 The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

x = min(26,48,89)
y = max(78,101,100)

print(x)
print(y)

#2

x = abs(-8.9)
print(x)

#3
x = pow(4,5)
print(x)

#4
import math

x = math.sqrt(64)
print(x)

#5  The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

import math

x = math.ceil(1.2)
y = math.floor(1.4)

print(x)
print(y)

#6
import math

x = math.pi
print(x)
